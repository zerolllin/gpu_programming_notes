# gpu_programming_notes

### GPU Premitives

- Grid, Thread block, Host and device functions
- SM, Warp, Warpgroup, Memory hierarchy (cache)
- Scheduling and pipelining

### Optimization Principles (with examples)

- Use little element-wise operations (kernel fusion)
- Reduce memory I/O
- Keep tensor core busy (GPU go burr)

### Coding languages and libraries

- cute
- Triton

### Tools

- Pytorch profiler
- Nsight compute
